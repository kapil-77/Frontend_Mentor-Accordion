## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

While beginning to develop any project you should follow mobile first approach otherwise you'll get stuck. Break the code into small steps don't try to figure it out all at once.

### Continued development

I do want to practice more javascript to be able to manipulate and play with the DOM elements. Doing it with react is kind of easy.
